# my-standard-libraries
Standard web design code and libraries.

There are pieces of code that I keep scattered across various web projects.  

On a windows PC, these can now be placed in c:\libraries

SASS, run with Koala, will understand that /libraries/sass/ points to t C:\libraries\sass

With this, I'm able to easily implement and include standard libraries across my tasks.
